## Project context

This repository contains one SvelteKit application. Projects are immutable event Timelines in PostgreSQL. The web process accepts asynchronous operations into those Timelines and executes them through a bounded in-process executor; interrupted work is explicitly failed and retried by the user.

Visualization modes are developer-registered in `src/lib/modes/catalog.ts`. The `sverlin` mode authors one import-free Svelte component that uses the injected library in `src/lib/modes/sverlin/library/`, `html` authors script-free frames, and `html-js` authors separate HTML and JavaScript. Each mode folder owns its assistant, starter artifact, validation/build implementation, and playback component. The sole main study in `src/lib/studies/main.ts` compares `sverlin` and `html`; `html-js` is outside that study. JavaScript from authored artifacts executes only in an opaque-origin sandboxed browser frame, never in the server process or application origin. Sanitize authored HTML with a library and reject external imports; an iframe alone cannot prove that arbitrary JS will never attempt navigation.

## Communication and documentation

- Write for developers familiar with programming but only basic DevOps. Be concise and explain operational constraints in plain language. Define unavoidable specialist terms at first meaningful use and link to authoritative sources when a definition would interrupt the explanation.
- In Markdown, link to existing repository files with relative links. Prefer a named heading or symbol to a drifting line anchor. Keep behavior claims close to their source of truth and distinguish established behavior from recommendations or assumptions.
- During guided external-service setup, account for every warning or error as blocking, actionable, or harmless before the next step. Verify external state with a read-only check when possible.
- Keep human-facing project documentation in the root `README.md`; do not add `docs/` or separate guides without approval. Avoid duplicating source-level detail. Temporary `HANDOVER.md`, machine-consumed prompt/index files, licenses, installed skills, and source-adjacent provenance are not project guides.
- Document the rationale and source for operational constants, limits, timeouts, and retry counts.
- In response code examples, keep ordinary readable expressions on one line rather than expanding every application vertically.

## Navigation and boundaries

- Environment-neutral schemas, Timeline projections, reusable study tooling, and transport contracts belong under `src/lib/shared/`; concrete study definitions under `src/lib/studies/`; browser sessions and UI under `src/lib/client/`; persistence, AI providers, and project commands under `src/lib/server/`.
- Each mode's browser-safe contract and starter, server build/bot, and playback live together under `src/lib/modes/<mode>/`. Keep server-only and browser-only entry points separate; preserve the one-way import rules in `eslint.config.js`.
- Stable direct URLs belong under `static/`. Generated shadcn-svelte component source belongs under `src/lib/client/components/ui/` with helper `src/lib/client/components/utils.ts`; `components.json` is authoritative for aliases. Use `pnpm dlx shadcn-svelte@latest` when adding or updating those components.
- The public Svelte component source contract is the mode starter and build implementation in `src/lib/modes/sverlin/`. Its assistant prompt belongs in the same folder. The static HTML and HTML/JS modes have distinct assistants; never make one bot serve more than one mode.

## Commands and operational state

- Run project commands inside the Dev Container. `.envrc` activates devenv in interactive terminals; for non-interactive execution use `devenv shell -- COMMAND`. Container setup runs `devenv tasks run sverlin:setup`. `devenv up` starts PostgreSQL and the app; `devenv up -d postgres` starts only PostgreSQL for tests; `devenv down` stops managed processes.
- `pnpm run dev` migrates the database and starts the SvelteKit server. `pnpm run dev:web` skips migrations but still executes asynchronous project operations. The web process runs mode-owned visualization builds and project operations. `pnpm run build` builds the Node application.
- Server launches reload the current `.env` through `scripts/run-with-env.sh`, using the same loader as devenv shells. After `.env` changes, coordinate a web-process restart (`devenv processes restart web`); the daemon and PostgreSQL do not need restarting. Do not route isolated test migrations through this launcher: their database URL must remain supplied by the test runner.
- Use `pnpm run export:data -- --scope projects` (optionally `--project PROJECT_ID` and `--output PATH`) to inspect complete project Timelines or retained operation failures. Do not bypass the canonical export with ad hoc PostgreSQL queries for that work; extend the export if important data is missing.
- The consolidated `drizzle/0000_lying_jean_grey.sql` is a fresh-database baseline. It does not migrate older compiler-era projects or authentication data. Verify the target database before any reset and never reset it implicitly during ordinary development.

## Engineering rules

- Source edits and non-serving checks may run while the developer's dev server is running. Reuse an existing server for browser verification; inspect listening ports and managed process status before starting another. Do not stop or restart developer-owned processes without permission. Run PostgreSQL integration tests through `pnpm run test:postgres`, which creates an isolated test database; do not run test cleanup or destructive commands against the development database. Request a coordinated restart only when configuration changes require one, and explain when hot reload could interrupt active work.
- If completing an active task requires a development-environment or agent restart, create/update a temporary root `HANDOVER.md` before stopping. Record objective, completed work, current working-tree ownership, next safe action, remaining blockers, validation, and operational state. On the first turn after restart, read it fully, inspect Git status/relevant diffs, verify recorded state, continue safely, and delete it after the resumed task is complete.
- Repository-local skills under `.agents/skills/` describe specialized work. Review applicable skills and follow them. Before adding a skill, explain the benefit and ask approval. Manage installed skills using `npx skills`, not manual edits to installed skill directories or `skills-lock.json`.
- Treat unfamiliar files and modifications as possible user work. Preserve the browser/server import boundary and project style. Update `README.md` in the same change when commands, setup, structure, generated artifacts, or user-facing workflow change.
- A new mode should add one folder plus one catalogue registration, not another cross-cutting assistant/mode mapping. Keep project intake, operations, attempts, persistence, and workspace controls mode-neutral; only mode-specific build, source, bot, and playback behavior belong in the mode folder.
- AI-generated source is validated/built before activation. Each operation has at most five explicit model calls: one initial Luna/low call, three Sol repairs (medium, high, xhigh), then one Sol/xhigh simpler fallback that explains the difficulty and reduction. Repairs reuse initial seeds; a batch activates atomically. Provider retries and open-ended loops are disabled. The default 180-second request ceiling fits inside the 15-minute study phase, and a repair starts only if its full timeout remains before the deadline. Timelines retain prompts, responses, diagnostics, source, accepted artifacts, and presentations.
- Generated JavaScript must not execute on the server or application origin. The authored HTML validator and the isolated iframe/CSP serve different purposes. Preserve the opaque origin (`sandbox="allow-scripts"` without `allow-same-origin`), no external imports, and restrictive resource/network directives. Do not claim HTML sanitization alone vets JS or that an iframe absolutely prevents own-frame navigation requests.

## Verification

- `pnpm run test:unit` is the fast TypeScript suite; `pnpm run test` also runs PostgreSQL integration tests. Use `devenv up -d postgres` first for the latter. Run `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run lint`, and focused mode/build tests after relevant changes.
- After Svelte component or module changes, run `pnpm run check`, the `@sveltejs/mcp` autofixer required by the repository skill, and manually verify affected browser interactions. There is no automated E2E suite. Do not add tests for reversible, low-impact changes that merely mirror implementation.
- For source compilation or sandbox changes, verify at least one real Svelte component build, static HTML sanitization, HTML/JS import rejection, and presentation playback behavior. For database schema changes, regenerate the baseline only with the developer-authorized fresh database workflow and run `pnpm run test:postgres`.
